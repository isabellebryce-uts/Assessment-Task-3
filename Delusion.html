  <h1>DELUSION</h1>

  <p>I was a prisoner, punished for the crime of losing my grasp of reality.</p>

    <p>Each day I would stand on my bed, my feet pressing against the metal frame as the flimsy mattress separated under my weight, and stare through the rusted bars. Three vertical strips of metal that presented my eyes to my one and only surrounding: water. When the storms were beyond control, I always imagined the entire institution flooding slowly, inch by inch, before it was underwater and past the point of recovery. I imagined this whole asylum detaching from the island and ceasing to exist.</p>
    
    <p>Each night, I huddled under the sheets and shivered to the endless whispering of my name.</p>

    <p>Clara. Clara. Clara.</p>
    
    <p>There were nights where it was sung like a distant melody, others when each syllable was enunciated to emphasise every letter in the word, and the fifth night of every week, the night I feared most, my name became a whistle in the wind. It distorted my hearing before it consumed me whole and the pale room would spin in circles before my eyes.</p>
    
    <p>Date and time were lost to the cackling laughter, moaning and groaning and the consistent dripping of water. The institution was hardly passable for suitable living conditions for the deranged. The floors, made of patterned linoleum, was scattered with rat droppings and stained with the occasional, yet frequent, drops of blood. The paint flaked and peeled over the failed attempts to disguise the constant desperate words scratched into the wall from previous patients. It was an asylum for the doomed; the moment one arrived on the desolate island, one’s endeavour for escape was to no avail against the crumbling cliffs, the jagged rock and the ocean’s immense ability to asphyxiate.</p>
    
    <p>Clara. Clara. Clara. </p> 
    
    <p> I survived with numbers, counting each night with a scratched line on the space of wall beside my pillow. That’s how I knew the fifty-fifth night would be the worst, and possibly last, night of my poor excuse for an existence.</p>
    
    <p>For on the fifty-fifth night, my name whistled and soared with the wind, almost diabolical in its looming presence.</p>
    
    <p>Clara. Clara. Clara.</p> 
    
    <p>It swept in through every bare crevice of the building, swarming the corridors slowly but surely, and I was certain by this point that my name was lurking in every cell.</p>
    
    <p>My body trembled and shrunk with the anguish tormenting me. I was condemned to evil, and I knew it from the moment that small voice whispered to me in the shadows of my cell. I could feel its presence. It was anything but human. There was no need to remove my hands from my eyes to see it for myself. Instead, I made my body as small as it could possibly be and huddled in the corner of my bed.</p>
    
    <p> But then, worst of all, everything became still. The storm suddenly abated, the dripping of water no longer audible and the patients, never failing to voice their distress, were quiet. There was complete and utter deafening silence.  I looked up as the door slid open, creaking and groaning with the effort.</p>
    
      <p> There was somebody in the room.</p>
    
    <p> “What do you want from me?” I whispered. “Who are you?” I yelled between gasps of breaths.</p>
    <p>The bed began to shake before the covers were strewn from my feet, flying across the room and colliding with the wall.</p>
    
    <p>I was forced into the air, hovering in one position where I was trapped in place. I couldn’t utter a single sound, or move any part of my body. It was as if there was some form of invisible force possessing my body. All I could do was watch in trepidation as the little availability of furniture in the room whirred in circles before splitting in half.</p>
    
    <p>There were guards flanking the door, thrusting their keys into a cell door which wouldn’t budge. They banged the metal uselessly, their mouths opened with words deprived of noise and meaning.</p>
    
    <p>“You killed me.” A voice finally filled my mind. “How could you kill me?” His voice. It was so familiar yet completely unknown. How could a voice be so powerful, a voice of sorrow and defeat, and clench my heart as if it was separate from my body?</p>
    
    <p>My vision swarmed until that very day, the day I was certain I could remove from my memory, replaced the mental asylum. The day that sentenced me to my insanity.</p>
    
    <p>***</p>
    
    <p>“Tell me when you no longer hear the beat of my heart.” He lied on the white sheets, pale and weak. I opened my mouth to respond but no words would form.</p>
    
    <p>Why would your heart stop? I wanted to ask, but I couldn’t. The words were floating at the back of my throat, yet every time I tried to grasp them they would catch on my tongue.</p>
    
    <p>You’re the only one I love.” I tried to step forward but my feet were glued to the tiled floors. He was so close to me yet simply out of reach.</p>
    
    <p>I love you. I needed to say it.</p>
    
    <p>“Tell me when you hear my silence.”</p>
    
    <p>Stop talking in riddles, I wanted to scream. Tell me what’s happening, I begged the words to manifest.</p>

    <p>“You radiate.” There was a small smile on his lips which were dimming with colour.</p>
    
    <p>Only with you. I opened my mouth again, breathing heavily with the failed attempt to communicate.</p>
    
    <p>“Clara, the girl of brightness and clarity.” I could feel my pulse begin to quicken with the feeling of confinement. It was as if I was watching him behind a screen of black and white colours.</p>
    
    <p>You’re fading, you’re dimming... His pale blue eyes started to droop. I was constricted for air, and the more hysterical I became, the less oxygen became available.</p>
    
    <p>“Half a soul is dark, half a soul is light.”</p>
    
<p>You are my light.</p>
    
<p>“Say something.”</p>  
    
<p> If only I knew how.</p>
    
<p>“Don’t let this fool you.” His hand shook as he gestured to his fragile body.</p>
    
<p>Death will fool me.</p>
    
<p>“I can see your wings beating, utterly invincible, invulnerable...”</p>
    
  <p>Please, no more riddles, just tell me the truth.</p>
    
    <p>“Please, Clara, stop crying.” It was only then that I recognised the tears collecting on my chest and the sobs enclosing my throat. The room echoed with my wails, the first sound emitting from my body. Finally, I stepped forward and I almost slipped on liquid beneath me. When I looked down, I was filled with dread with the sight of blood smeared all over the floor.</p>
    
    <p>“Your skin is so pale.” My voice was hoarse. “And–and there’s so much blood on your sheets.”</p>
    
    <p>“We’ll be okay.”</p>
    
    <p>“What have I done to you?” I whispered between waves of overpowering despair.</p>
    
    <p>“Look down at your hands.” He murmured after a few moments.</p>
    
    <p>There was a knife, long, sharp and covered in blood.</p>
    
    <p>“Hold onto your wings.” His eyes closed.</p>
    
    <p>I screamed, and screamed, and screamed, because that’s all I could do.</p>
    
    <p>***</p>
    
    <p>He released me from the air and I collapsed onto the mattress, my vision blurring as my head slammed into the wall beside me. I screamed, and sobbed, and writhed in pain. The pain of everything. The pain of being trapped, the pain of isolation, the pain of loss…</p>
    
    <p>“Why am I in here?” I cried, grasping at the air to feel his presence. “I’m sane! That night was a simple mistake, we destroyed each other.” The room remained still. “Please, you need to save me! Save me from these doctors, from these patients, from your haunting ghost…I need you to save me from myself! I’ve lasted fifty-four days but I don’t know how much longer I can survive in this place.”</p>
    
    <p>I could hear the distant sound of scraping, alternating in pitches as the words formed through the paint:
    ‘It’s your time to fly.’</p>       
                     
    <p>The door opened inaudibly and when I stood at the entrance, eerily, there was no one in sight. The guards had disappeared and the rooms surrounding my own were empty. Hesitantly, I stepped outside the room, feeling as if the moment I exited sirens would explode with objection and guards would tackle me to the ground.</p>
    
    <p>One step, two, three…nothing happened. I was halfway down the hall when I realised I was at a loss as to direction. In this institute, one was strictly guided from room to room.</p>
    
    <p>The lighting was limited along each corridor I turned, flickering and pale lined along the top of each rusted door. Besides from my heavy footsteps and exhausted panting, the institution was still unusually and abnormally vacant. The further I walked, the darker the corridors became and staircases were appearing frequently. My heart thumped profoundly in my chest with the constant anticipation of someone, anyone, appearing abruptly.</p>
    
    <p>“You’re running out of time.” I heard a whisper, and it was so intrusive to the silence that I tripped on the step below me. Ignoring the ache in my legs and the stitch in my stomach, I gripped the banister tightly to pull myself to my feet and I, the tethered bird, fled with almighty strength and terror.</p>
    <P>“They’re coming for you, can’t you hear them?” I stumbled again, my speed breaking at the second whisper. “They’re two stories above you, and they’ve found out you’re gone.”</p>
    
    <p>“I don’t know where I’m going.” I cried the moment light transformed from dimly perceivable to absolute darkness. “Please, you need to help me.” I felt a cool breeze brush the back of my neck saturated with sweat until it increased in its force, controlling my footsteps with vigorous movement. I gripped the slimy walls for balance, for at least some form of guidance in a place of such obscurity. The distant footsteps behind me escalated in volume, and as I fastened my pace, so did the treading behind me.</p>
    
    <p>The hysteria built in the pit of my stomach, travelling to my throat with such vicious intensity I heaved for air, any air that would free me from this world. I was living in a world of delusion; freedom was an absent dream and reality was tormenting.</p>
    
    <p>When I collapsed, I fell through a door of rain. The storm had begun again; the air so thick with fog it distorted my vision to the extent I could hardly see five metres in front of me. Sloshing through the muddy grass, I focused on distancing myself from the gray building behind me, heading to the thick expanse of trees lining the brick fence.</p>
    
    <p> Beyond that fence, there stood a cliff.</p>
    
    <p>“Clara!” I heard a chorus of shouts from the building. “Clara, you need to come back to your room!” I turned, momentarily to view the guards dressed in their navy blue uniform glued to the spot one hundred metres away from me, suspended from movement. It was him, I decided then, giving me more time. He was holding them in place for the opportunity of my liberty.</p>
    
    <p>The water crashed on the rocks beneath the cliff in pure fury. Standing on the edge, the wind whipped my stained white dress, my matted blonde hair and destroyed all reasonable sense.</p>
    
    <p>For what does a person become when the contents inside their skull transform to pure lunacy? When mental derangement engulfs the entirety of a person’s brain? What is the result of a person who loses the grasp of the line between real life and make-believe because the difference is blurred to the stage where the acknowledgement is unnecessary? Is madness where realism and fantasy are drawn together and all aspects to do with the method of normality are lost?</p>
    
    <p>I am wholly insane and wholly sane.</p>
    
    <p>When the placement of feet reaches the edge of a cliff, the night is too old, streaked entirely with black, and the air is bitter, reflecting the poor quality of my life, one step into the darkness becomes irresistible.</p>
    
    <p>“’Hold onto your wings’.” I murmured. “It’s my time to fly.”</p>
