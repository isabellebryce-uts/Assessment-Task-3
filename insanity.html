  <h1> INSANITY - PART ONE </h1>

  <p>"Talk to me, tell me what you're thinking." </p>

  <p>Sanity is so fragile. In order to be sane, you need to possess the ability to think and behave in a normal and rational manner. </p>

  <p>Your sanity can be altered, I believe, if you allow yourself to be open to pain. For how does one act rational in the matter of extreme pain? Does insanity, in reality, exist? Or is insanity simply the result of life experiences? What is madness? What does a deranged person become? What does a person become when the content inside their skull transforms to pure and utter lunacy? When mental derangement engulfs the entirety of a person’s brain? What is the result of a person who loses the grasp of the line between real life and make-believe because the difference of either two is blurred to the stage where the acknowledgement is unnecessary? Is madness where realism and fantasy is drawn together and all aspects to do with the method of normality is lost? </p>

  <p>That is what I’m thinking, I feel like screaming at the psychologist observing me as if I was a lab experiment.</p>

  <p>“Come on Skye, I can just imagine your mind screaming with thoughts desperate to escape.” I find the most annoying attribute of my psychologist is how undeniably pretty she is. Because here she is, jabbing and dissecting every single piece of my life and my thoughts and my emotions and my actions with her pearly white teeth and face where every feature is well-proportioned and there’s not a flawed part to it. And while she is intruding my life which is confusing and dysfunctional, her pretty face seems to create a perfect image, like a shiny armour enclosing her body which breathes success and only makes me feel shittier about who I am as a person. </p>

  <p>“I’m thinking a number of things.” My mother was paying God-knows-how-much per session with this nuisance and all she does is stare, and prod, and smile, and nod and continue to prod even when we both know I’m not telling her anything valuable. </p>

  <p>“Name one thought, describe it to me.” A glimpse of white, a hint of a smile close to displaying teeth. One thought? I’m lucky to even think one thought at a time. It starts at one, I suppose, but then the thoughts keep swarming and there are so many different thoughts at one time I can’t focus on one thought and I feel as if my head could explode. It’s times like that when I wish I was too numb to think. </p>

  <p>“My thoughts still haven’t changed from last session.” </p>

  <p>“Look, I understand this is only your second session and you’ve distanced yourself from me, but these sessions are your opportunities to open up, to release all the feelings and thoughts and words which cause sleepless nights, distraction from school and an inability to let go of the past.”</p>

  <p>I rolled my eyes, diverting my attention from the psychologist as I stood up, moving to the floor to ceiling window beside me.  All the activity approximately thirty stories underneath my feet resembled insignificant ants hidden by tiny umbrellas. Hundreds of ants rushing through endless roads occupied by insignificant vehicles. I watched the rain splattering against the window, exiting dark clouds consuming the sky.  I observed the numerous other buildings surrounding me, all confronting with their startling height and size. I pressed my body to the window, the coolness of the glass seeping onto my skin and erupting goosebumps on my arms. With my forehead rested against the window, i glanced down to the top of my boots, curved slightly with the incapability to take another step and imagined that is what depression would feel like. Constricted by something so breakable, so easily shattered, like glass, but feeling imprisoned by a demon you can’t escape. </p>

  <p>“Come on Skye; tell me what you’re thinking right now.” The scent of the sickly sweet perfume of the psychologist drifted into my senses with the light wave of air from the air conditioner. “I can see by your slumped posture your feeling something negative. Just tell me what you’re thinking.”</p>

  <p> I’m thinking about my forehead colliding with the glass repeatedly until the glass cracks and explodes into a million pieces creating a pool of shimmering diamonds on the floor it falls on. Then, I, myself, would fall, fall, fall deep into the depths of the unknown. </p>
