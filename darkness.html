  <h1>DARKNESS</h1>

  <p>Darkness. The word commonly misunderstood. For no one understands the true beauty or the true fear which is brought forth on the absence of light. It matches ones vision of gazing into the night sky without the single hint of the sparkling shape of stars. It provides the opportunity to reflect. It provides the opportunity of isolation from the city lights and dial tones that disrupt the tranquillity. It’s almost laughable at the events which result in the peaceful respect of such gloom which carries the obscurity of life. Whether it is death or the production of life, humans don’t completely understand the significance of such moments until they are ripped from the loose grasps of finger tips. And the finger tips will flail and fly in the ridiculous ounce of hope for the restoration which will not be delivered. Because all is lost in the darkness. But whether the loss is positive or negative is what is to be debated.</p>

  <p>Thoughts will forever be clouded with murkiness undesired. Thoughts will be misshapen and images will be distorted to a blurry jumble of confusion and helplessness. And maybe, just maybe, the darkness becomes desirable because the temptation seems so utterly sweet.</p>

  <p>Humans will forever argue over the quality of life. Yet the quality of life cannot be created if the desperation for excellence is overbearing. It’s like wishing for the wellbeing of a goldfish when you remove it from the water. But maybe this is only the envy beginning to plant a seed in the brain.
    When life’s offers are empty of happiness, the sadness is suffocating. The particular sadness which tightens the grip around your throat every single day before air is limited and what little saliva is created can barely be swallowed. Maybe because life and death are inevitable. Two distinct concepts that are linked together unthinkably yet can be reached from only one side. Why is it with the control a human possesses over their body, the power allows the removal of life yet the dead can’t proceed in the creation of life?</p>

    <p>Although when the placement of feet reach the edge of a cliff, the night is too old, streaked entirely with black, and the air is bitter much like the quality at which you live, one step into the darkness becomes irresistible. </p>
