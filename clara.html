  <h1>CLARA AND CHRISTIAN - PART ONE </h1>

  <p>There was a man. </p>

  <p>Stoned, drunk or mentally unwell, he stumbled along the road with his ears deaf and eyes blind to the beeping of horns. Cars braked and swerved around him, but he persevered through it all, intent on reaching the foot path barely ten metres from him. With hair grey and balding, stained, baggy clothes and bare feet, the man raised his right arm in the air, a finger pointed straight ahead. A finger pointed at me. I did not move, nor did I feel fear. For a reason I could not possibly grasp, I was enthralled by this strange man. He was not granted any charm or beauty with his wrinkled skin and the limping movement of each stride.</p>

  <p>"You've dropped something." Two meters away. His voice was raspy, suffocated from the years of alcohol and drug abuse. "You've dropped your wings, there, look." His scarred hand shook as he lowered it to the concrete beside me. "You've dropped your wings, you'll be going to heaven tonight." I couldn't breathe. I was too constricted. The air was insufficient. My heart is beating too hard. My throat is too tight. Why aren't I moving fast enough? Where are my legs, my feet, my muscles, my stamina?</p>

  <p>Where are you, Clara, where are you hiding? </p>

  <p>The salt water was stinging my skin before I knew I even had made it to the beach. The cold water seeped into my skin, befriending the numbness in my heart. It lapped over my body with each ripple of the waves, entangling with pure blonde strands of hair, with the weight of clothes, with the weight of all my sorrows, all my pain. </p>

  <p>His voice consumed me now. Just as it always did. </p>
