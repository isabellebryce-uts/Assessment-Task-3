  <h1>DARKNESS VERSUS LIGHT</h1>

  <p>Freedom.</p>

  <p>A word which stings the tip of my tongue; a word which exists, yet the act of it is only a figment of my imagination. </p>

  <p>What must it feel like for your feet to collide with the ground and your limbs to form the movement of running not with the intention to escape, but simply because you’re granted the pure beauty of independence and the sovereignty to control the aspects of your life? Or for cheeks to stretch with the curving of lips into a symbol of happiness, with skin kissed by the sun and without the weight of wishing you were anyone but the person you are?</p>

  <p>The darkness of my skin is not a privilege, but a curse. An obscenity which abolishes my worth as a person and destroys all normality of a life I crave so desperately. Because, this isn’t life; life shouldn’t result in fearing humans to the extent where you’re questioning, at the beginning of one day, whether you will still be in existence once the sun has fallen. And even once the presence of stars is noticed, the limited light in which they radiate is not a beacon of hope but the representation of the white skinned demons. For the stars streak the blackness, signalling their ownership and supremacy.</p>

  <p>Bitter thoughts swept through my mind, thoughts on freedom which did nothing but make me feel miserable. They were as unwelcome as the sweat that formed in small beads in the centre of my forehead. The sun beat down on each worker and the daunting heat enflamed the skin under the straw sack wrapped around my neck. My nails cracked with the endless hours of harvesting cotton from storks, placing the fibre into the sack and then repeating the tedious process. As on every other day, I was grateful for the sinking of the sun which meant that the gathering would soon come to an end.
    Navigating to the ramshackle hut, which barely fit nine other slaves and myself, was always difficult with the darkness of the night distorting the shape of objects. The pleasant expanse of greenery and the majesty of towering oak trees were lost to the blackness, and that, indeed, was always a disappointment as the beauty of the scenery provided at least an ounce of happiness. </p>

    <p>Each aching movement of my limbs proved to be a reminder of my exhaustion as I carefully lay down on the bundle of straw. The closing of my eyes allowed me to escape from reality, at least for a few hours.
      There was the quiet shuffling of feet behind me and I froze, my eyes widening in fear. There was a shadow on the wall of the panels in the dimness of the moonlight. I squeezed my hands tightly together, praying to God it wasn’t one of those white folks and begging for protection from my Lord.</p>

      <p>“Abigail?” I breathed a sigh of relief with the soft whisper as the small, familiar figure slid into the space beside me. Her slow breaths gently brushed my shoulder as she lessened the gap between us. “Abigail?” She whispered again.</p>

      <p>“Yes, Meriday?”</p>

      <p>“I’m having those thoughts again.” I turned on my side, the unpleasant odour of perspiration and dirt engulfing my nostrils with any sudden movement. “The ones you say are dangerous.”</p>

      <p>“This is about survival, Meriday. There is no quality of life on plantations.”</p>

      <p>“Well, maybe I don’t wish to seek survival if this is to be my life.”</p>

      <p>“Now, you listen to me.” I grasped her hand tightly in my own, demanding her attention. “Rebelling does not make you courageous, it makes you dumb. Because you rebel, you die and no one cares.”</p>

      <p>She was silent, and that was when I knew there truly was a problem. Minutes later the words escaped into the night air, lingering with their perilous presence, “Then you clearly fail to understand the concept of life.”</p>

      <p>Dawn appeared undesirably fast, as it always did. Insufficient rations of breakfast were shared among the members of my hut before our work was forced to begin with the sun hesitantly rising. The sky was streaked with the flushness of pink before the colours mixed to form a glowing apricot.
        Black person after black person were situated in rows behind the storks where the process of harvesting begun once again for the day. Our Master scrutinized intently on his mounted horse, a whip in hand while trotting backwards and forwards endlessly.</p>

        <p>The dried bristles of the plants continuously caused my fingers to bleed, slicing wounds which struggled to heal with each movement of separating the cotton from the stork. Each hour passed painfully slow, a sack filling with cotton which was important to fulfil our daily quotas.</p>

        <p>Once Meriday captured my attention, my worry increased with the fierceness lacing her features; tight pursing of her plump lips and eyebrows furrowed in determination. She had created a plan, and I could only dread what the consequences would be.</p>

        <p>Sunset eventually arrived and the line formed for the weighing of cotton. I stood at the end of the line for females which decreased as each person met the sufficient quota for the weight of the cotton.</p>

        <p>There were three people until Meriday’s turn.</p>

        <p>The next person weighed their cotton.</p>

        <p>The second person weighed their cotton.</p>

        <p>And then there was the roar of pure outrage.</p>

        <p>Each sack containing cotton was required to weigh seventy pounds of cotton each day and you were given lashes of the whip each pound you were short.</p>

        <p>Meriday’s bag was empty.</p>

        <p>The whippings began instantly.</p>

        <p>Her lips oozed with crimson liquid, trickling down her chin before forming stains on the dirt near her knees. A sheet of hair framed Meriday’s face like a curtain with the loss of strength for her head to remain high. Her neck arched with her chin brushing the ripped fabric covering her chest. Another five whips echoed against her skin, the ear-splitting noise entering the air thick with dust. Each struck of the durable material pierced my heart with my teary eyes viewing the pain brought amongst my best friend.</p>

        <p>My throat thickened with my insistence to breathe a breath which was not smothered by the clutching hands of not only sorrow, but of infuriation. My vision transformed to one of blurriness, with moisture clouding my line of sight. Droplets of grief seeped from the confinement of my eye to the sun-burnt skin of my cheeks.</p>

        <p>She was going to die.</p>

        <p>I despised life enough as it is, and without the presence of Meriday, I did not want to belong in this world.</p>

        <p>Life is a strange concept. You’re placed on this earth with the intention to survive, or the motive of questioning the reason for the creation of your life to begin with. It consists of a number of limited days which contain vast amounts of joy for the privileged and immense onslaughts of pain for those unfortunate. Life is short, far too short to hesitate in moments of spontaneity.
          I stepped forward, unsure of the irrational thoughts bouncing through the inside of my skull yet determined to end this once and for all. My fingers curled to form fists, my actions driven by fortitude with the second step of my exhausted feet.</p>

          <p>The whip rose into the air, the movement slowing with the fixation of time. Meriday’s cracked lips opened with cries of pain absent to my ears, for all surroundings lost noise as perception vanished.</p>

          <p>The exact moment the whip collided to my cheek, we fell to the ground which welcomed all fatigue and agony.</p>

          <p>“It’s okay.” I whispered, brushing the tears from her swollen cheeks. “It’s finally okay.” My soothing strokes trailed to the side of her face. “This is our time to be brave.”</p>

          <p>A loud sob escaped her cracked lips. “You didn’t have to save me.” Meriday heaved, coughing violently with blood leaking from her mouth. “I wanted to die.” She heaved again, her thin frame representing one of fragility with the wave of shaking controlling her body. “Now you’re going to die, too”</p>

          <p>“You taught me to never think about what’s in my heart or what my home is. And I learnt you’re in my heart, you’re my home, and I didn’t need to think twice the moment I decided our souls formed a bond stronger than blood, stronger than life itself.” I struggled to speak. I was sobbing so hard the words I needed to say were barely audible. “I don’t wish to seek survival if this is to be my life.” I quoted, the trembling of our bodies syncing with the increase of weeping.</p>

          <p>The bullet clicked into place the moment the sound of boots crunched against rocks. Meriday clung to my body, her small head resting to my chest as I held her tightly. “This is the end.” Meriday said quietly. “This is goodbye.”</p>

          <p>And we disappeared with the night. </p>
