  <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

  <p>The Young Creator is a creative writing blog, containing fiction short stories, writing extracts, thoughts or experiences. It will be a blog to engage. A blog to flee from reality, at least for a little while. Join The Young Creator and her journey of words. Escape with writing.</p>

  <p> All work has been written by Isabelle Bryce.</p>
