  <h1>TIMELESS</h1>

  <p>There was a small box, an important box at that, which I kept hidden. It resembled neither colour nor texture; it was invisible and held no shape. But it radiated light, and warmth and brightness and all magical feelings. It was a box, I believed, which held me together. And where was this box stored, you may question. It was stored in the cerebral cortex, in the frontal lobe, however it was positioned snugly towards the deepest depth of my brain, where it couldn’t be touched or altered. It was a box of what I wished to never forget; my precious memories. </p>

  <p>It was the eyes. One glance and you would lose yourself in a forest. But no, you weren’t only standing in the forest amongst a sea of vibrant colours, but above. For his eyes resembled the green of the healthiest leaves with specks of gold appearing through the gaps of the green from the sun.</p>

  <p>It was in that exact moment I desired the skill of drawing or some physical visual form of his eyes where they would never cease to exist. But the best I had was my box, so I placed it in carefully, absorbing every speck of the variations of green and gold. </p>

  <p>It would be such a typical love story, if we were to ever fall in love, I admitted to myself. He, the handsome country boy who’s most useful form of transport was a tanned horse, groomed to perfection, and myself, a city girl who was not wealthy, yet never ventured far enough for the gaps between housing to remain for hectares at a time. I shook my head, as if to break myself from my reverie which occurred frequently, the disadvantage of having a wandering mind. A mind which constantly sought and clutched onto experiences before dissecting the events until they cohered smoothly and elegantly. A mind which explored all different types of non-existent concepts. To this day, even at eighteen years of age, I was still unsure if I appreciated having such an analytical brain.</p>

  <p>I’m unaware as to if he realised his actions and his demeanour, but everything about him seemed smooth and relaxed. As if he knew who he was and his position in life and he was sure of himself, but not in the sense of vanity, in the sense of admirable confidence.</p>

  <p>Let me paint the picture, although not physically obviously because drawing is definitely not my talent: I stood gracefully (I would hope so) from the car, my pristine leather flats marked by the dust of the dirt. The wind was wild and roared with life, controlling caramel coloured strands of hair and daring the hem of a pale pinking dress to fly with it. Small hands clad in white gloves held clothing and hair in place, at least as much as possible. I was in the middle of nowhere with a broken down car and a driver who lacked mechanical knowledge or skills. I gazed around, and all which was visible was bush, grass and a narrow dirt road for vehicles to drive along. I thought I would be panicked by the fact we were stranded basically in the middle of nowhere and there would have to be kilometres until we reached the house. But the scenery and the nature were soothing. Some might say so many bushes are suffocating, that the sight of so much natural environment would suggest being stranded. Because being stranded meant lacking access to anything vital. However, for me, it was a breath of fresh air with the absence of human-made buildings and developments. There was plenty of air at that. </p>

  <p>“Alice,” The driver called as I began to walk away, “Where are you going?” </p>

  <p>I turned and the sun basked my neck with warmth. I closed my eyes momentarily. “I’m walking, Mr Roberts. How else am I supposed to visit my sister now?” </p>

  <p>“Stay here with me, Alice.” Mr Roberts was a kind, frail old man who told me he would never stop driving until his body was physically unable to function and process such actions. “I don’t want you walking by yourself, who knows what danger might arise.” He rubbed his grey beard tiredly, resting his other hand on the open bonnet of the car. </p>

  <p>I twirled in a circle, my arms forming wings around my body. “The day is too beautiful Mr Roberts, far too beautiful not to experience it.” </p>

  <p>I heard the faintest noise of clicking, then the gentle sound of ta-dum ta-daum ta-dum before the volume increased and when I turned, there was a horse galloping towards us. The horse halted in front of me with the tugging of reigns, and the handsome man nodded down at me with his hat tilted to the side. I blinked once, twice, my lips parting with no words escaping. It was the strangest sensation, of being left breathless and thoughtless by someone’s physical beauty. It made me question genes and chromosomes and all things in-between.  </p>

  <p>And then finally he spoke, “You must be Elizabeth’s younger sister.” His voice was strong and loud but gentle all at once. </p>

  <p>“Alice,” I cleared my throat, “Alice Skogland.” </p>

  <p>“Well, it’s very nice to finally meet you. I’m Christopher Green, Ray’s younger brother.” Christopher Green. His name was solid and sound. Christopher Green. </p>

  <p>“Ray?” </p>

  <p>“Your sister’s partner. I believe this is the first time meeting us all.” I nodded once before shyly turning to look at Mr Roberts who was still bent over the car. Christopher acknowledged my line of vision. “My mother told me to ride along the track in case of any complications. It was lucky I did.” For the first time, he smiled with all his teeth and it was simply dazzling. Who knew a boy could be so charming? “Why don’t you ride with me to the house and then I’ll make sure we can assist your driver.” I nodded again, because all words or any valuable sentence or thoughts were lost because all I could see and breathe and hear was him. </p>

  <p>With grace and agility, he leaped from his horse and before I knew it, his hands were pressed to the sides of my waist and he was lifting me onto the horse, side-saddle. He climbed on in front of me, taking hold of the reigns before the horse began to trot. </p>

  <p>The farther down the track we travelled, the trees thickened and the path grew even more narrow and I was unsure as to how cars even made it this far. The birds were screeching and squawking as well as some fluttering into the cloudless sky. </p>

  <p>After a few kilometres, the tree began to thin and grassy fields came into view. “It’s so lovely here.”</p>

  <p>Christopher glanced at me from behind his shoulder. “It’s something you can’t get sick of.” The horse slowed to a walk with the nudge of Christopher’s foot. “It’s just the realness that I love.”</p>

  <p>“The realness?”</p>

  <p>“The scent, the sight, the feeling.” And that’s all he said. So I closed my eyes, rocking side to side ever so slightly with the movement of the horse’s steps, breathing in deeply through my nose. I could smell nothing but the sensation of air, but I suppose I understood what he meant by the realness, because the air had been kept as it should be; clear and fresh. And it felt invigorating, it felt as if I was free. But I’m unsure as to what I was free from. </p>

  <p>The whole experience was so strangely surreal.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, I lurched forward with the horse changing his stride to a gallop. Christopher guided the reigns to the left, straying off the dirt-road and through the dense bush, leaves and sticks crushing under the weight of the horse’s hooves.</p>

  <p>The trees thinned as the grass began to slope downwards slightly before meeting a creek at the base. Christopher leaped from the horse and then turned, gently lifting me and placing me on my two feet. His hands didn’t linger; his touch only occurred when it was most needed. </p>

  <p>“Why did we stop?” I followed Christopher to the edge of the murky creek, watching his square shoulders and lean body from behind. His white button-up shirt clung to his back, small beads of sweat visible through the thin material. He sat on a large rock, shoving his hands in his dark trousers and looking up at me calmly. </p>

  <p>Christopher’s sun-kissed face was narrow yet defined with a distinct jawline and noticeable cheek bones which levelled in line with the bottom of his ear lobe when he smiled. He was not oblivious to my watching eyes; he removed his hat revealing his high forehead and thick eyebrows, which failed to meet at the middle, yet led me to the bridge of his thin nose which was perfectly straight. His eyes never left mine; and I imagined combining the two colours in which the contact created. It would be his green and mine blue; the water and the trees. </p>

  <p>“What are you thinking?” His voice was quiet. </p>

  <p>“I’m thinking of the ocean and the forest.” </p>

  <p>“Why is that?”</p>

  <p>I smiled softly. “Because it’s the colours we’re creating.” He smiled in return, only with his small lips, and my own faltered, and I couldn’t breathe and I began to question humanity, fate, the concept of being and Christopher Green. Who was he? Everything about him was dipped in familiarity, yet that was simply impossible. He was a stranger, we made acquaintances no longer than twenty minutes ago. </p>

  <p>I turned away, focusing on the rushing river running over slippery rocks, the heat of the sun reddening my fair skin, the millions of small fishes which would have to be in the water in this current moment. I focused on minor details to divert my attention from the major art piece. </p>

  <p>“Because you’re contagious.” I froze. I did not answer. I did not turn to him. “You asked why I stopped, why we were here and that is your answer.”</p>

  <p>Words caught in my throat. </p>

  <p>“You innocence, your high spirits, your delicacy,” Christopher paused, “Your beauty. I did not want to escape it.” </p>

  <p>My chest tightened and inside there was my profusely beating heart. Ba bump ba bump ba bump ba bump. I turned to him finally, afraid he could hear the thumping of my heart and see the emotion in my eyes. </p>

  <p>“Who are you?” I whispered, staring at Christopher intently as he rose from the rock, holding his hat in both hands by his front. Dark hair parted to the side, creating a small, neat wave on the top of his head, Christopher stepped forward. I step back with each step he took forward. But then I lost my footing on an imbalanced piece of rock and tumbled on my behind, lying their motionless and staring up at the sky. It was an azure canvas, infinite and inevitable. My own canvas. </p>

  <p>“Dear Alice, are you okay?” Christopher kneeled beside me, frowning in confusion when I began to laugh. And laugh. And laugh. He smiled, “What’s the matter with you?”</p>

  <p>I wipe at my eyes, holding my stomach and adjusting my position so I was lying with my body facing Christopher. “If this is your effect on me the day we meet, how will I be a month from now?” </p>

  <p>Christopher smiled, and I prayed for the wind to change because, oh, how could I could ever get enough of his smile? He laid beside me on his back, one foot propped up with the other leg extended on the ground. “Alice Skogland.” I heard him murmur.</p>

  <p>***</p>

  <p>That was my first encounter with Christopher Green. On that sweltering summer’s day in 1945. Even to this day, the memories I kept in my special box are intensely vivid, like a clear videotape running behind my closed eyes. I find it strange the ability to remember and forget. The ability for our brain to cause some memories to fade and for others to thrive. It’s as if our memories are a careful selection we unawarely choose to remember. Both the good and bad, pleasure and pain, happiness and sadness. It is what we remember which shapes the person we become and what we forget which were only minor components of life. I appreciate my special box immensely. Some may laugh at such a ridiculous idea; keeping an imaginary box in your brain, but it’s all I have left of Christopher which are my own. You see, there are the photographs of course but they grasp no true sense of (another word for personal). Because those images are seen through a lens and my memories are seen through my eyes. Photographs, however, are what I use for the physical grasp of my memories.</p>

  <p>I lie in bed, clutching a framed photo of Christopher and myself a few days after I met him.</p>

  <p>‘Monday, 31st of October, 1945. Swimming in Wybray’ the stained back of the photograph read in a bold, cursive script.</p>

  <p>***</p>

  <p>“Are you sure this is safe for swimming, Ray?” My sister stood on the edge of the rock in her crimson bathing suit, eyeing the rushing current of the creek in doubt. “It looks fairly dangerous Ray!” She called out in a nervous voice. </p>

  <p>“Elizabeth, darling, do you think I would do anything to put you in danger?” He rolled his deep chocolate eyes at me, contrasting with his brother’s light ones. “Plus, we don’t swim here.”</p>

  <p>“Then where do we swim?” Elizabeth carefully walked beside him, cautious of slippery or sharp rocks on her bare feet. </p>

  <p>“You’re far too impatient my young lady.” Ray stared down at her adoringly, the height difference between them not as significant compared to when I stand beside Christopher. My sister glanced up at him also, her own blue eyes gleaming with her happiness. </p>

  <p>There were numerous physical differences between Elizabeth and myself such as her being slightly taller than my five foot five build, her large bust and proportioned body compared to my small waist and bust with curvier thighs and bottom, yet there was no denying we were sisters. Our facial features said it all; from the colour of our eyes to their exact wide and round shape as well as the oval contour of our face and small, thin lips. It was in our personalities where the relations weren’t displayed.
    The rocks sloped downwards where the creek rushed into a small pool which was gentle and calm, not moving except for the spattering of the water falling at the entry. It was more shaded here with tall trees lining the circular pool of water, a sweet escape from the blistering sun. The area was private and sheltered, so secluded you felt as if you were the only people on the universe. </p>

    <p>“Take out your hair.” I froze at the closeness of Christopher, almost jumping at his sudden smooth voice beside me. </p>

    <p>“What?” I turned to him nervously, feeling his warm breath span the back of my neck. </p>

    <p>“Take it out, I want to see your hair wild and flowing, the blonde strands shining with the reflection of the sun.” My fingers brushed the tight braid on the top of my head before meeting at the base of my neck where the strands rolled round and round to form a neat bun. Christopher jumped in the water before I could respond, cool water splashing at my feet. When he rose above the surface, summoning air, my hair was free from all confinements; curly and wild from the braid twisting the strands. He grinned up at me while treading water, droplets glistening on his forehead. </p>

    <p>I was no longer standing; I was flying. Shooting though the air with arms locked tightly above my head, my body arched before I glided smoothly through the water. </p>

    <p>“I didn’t think a city girl like yourself could dive like that.” Ray splashed water at me teasingly.</p>

    <p>“So stereotypical of you.” I kicked water in his direction using my foot, gracefully backstroking until I floated in the centre of the river. My hair spanned beneath my body, a thick curtain lightly carried by the water. </p>

    <p>Whenever I visited the beach, I would swim beyond the crashing waves, to the back of the set where the water was out of reach of destruction. And I would float as I am now, all sense of perception lost. The water replaced my senses, for it became a part of me. My ears were below the level of water so it was all I heard. It lapped my body so it was all I could feel. The water tickled my fingertips so it was all I could touch. The salty air consumed my nostrils, even my tongue until it was all I could smell and taste. My eyes were closed yet it was all I could see. And I would just float. Swaying with the gentle forwards and backwards rock of the current, believing this is peace, this is as tranquil as the world could ever be. </p>

    <p>“What are you thinking?” I didn’t even have to open my eyes to know it was his voice, floating to my ears like his body hovering beside me in the river. It was distant, separated through the water between us. </p>

    <p>“Floating in the water, especially in the currents of waves, is when I’m at my calmest.” I murmured.</p>

    <p>“You know, whenever I can’t sleep for any reason, I lie in bed and imagine I’m lying in the water, and I imagine my body undulating to the gentle rhythm, as if it was the ocean rocking me to sleep.” </p>

    <p>He didn’t respond, neither did we speak after that. We just continued to float side by side, occasionally a bare arm brushing one another or even a leg. Words seemed inessential in such a moment, because the content controlled us and was the producer of the conversation.</p>

    <p>We were at the river for a few hours, swinging into the water on a long, thick strand of rope connected to a tree branch and swimming until we were logged with water. We laid on a nearby rock, quickly losing the presence of moisture with the inescapable heat. </p>

    <p>“I’ve never seen your hair so blonde before.” Elizabeth fiddled with a strand of my hair with my head rested on her chest. “It must be all this sun.” I hummed distractedly in response, secretly admiring Christopher leant against a rock opposite us. His lean body was toned and muscular; his hard work and active life on his parent’s property displayed prominently. He was constantly busy on the property; from caring for the animals to digging holes for construction, the past three days since my arrival I have not once seen him fail to be of aid to his parents, or to anyone else for that matter.</p>

    <p>***</p>

    <p>You spend your life, I feel, wishing away the days and then you question the rapid speed at which time flied, wondering how the present arrived when it once felt like an eternity before you would ever encounter the fierceness of the future. It wasn’t that I was unhappy with the present, that is far beyond the point because I’m surrounded by family and love and all wonderful things. But I miss the past when there was no loss or pain and I was whole without the absent pieces removed from my body. In the present, the past has left me with my gaping wounds and bleeding from the inside out, with no one to see the evidence of such pain. </p>

    <p>It is in moments of such sadness I wish the three stages of life, present, past and future, was not connected, but individual. That in return, I suppose, is like asking for a life without faults. We are all doomed to suffer, some more than others. That is the truth of it all. What is the point of this? The point of all this pain? It is suffocating, smothering and granted with too much power. </p>

    <p>I’m an optimist and a pessimist mixed into one person. I see the light yet surround myself in darkness. The darkness is disguised as my pain and my desire to continue living, to continue fighting is the fleck of light I see. Only a fleck, but it drives me forward. </p>

    <p>There’s times where I ask myself, was he really worth it, Alice? And then I hate myself for even asking that question. Of course he was worth it, is worth it. He invaded my body and marked myself as his. Our souls entwined together until it was made of the same substance.  </p>
