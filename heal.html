  <h1> HEAL </h1>

  <p>"Can I take you somewhere?" He murmured, consumed with the power of love and happiness and all elements that squeezed at his heart.</p>

  <p>She smiled, this beautiful creature aware of her own ravishing elegance yet controlled it with modesty. "Take me where?"</p>

  <p>"Take you anywhere; to the mountain side, to the country side...we can go as far as you want to go." He feared this young lady; he was terrified of losing her.</p>

  <p>She leaped from the sand with poise, the smile he fell in love with constantly forming her lips. Her smile was a separate entity altogether; she never ceased to display her happiness. She smiled, and smiled, and smiled; it was her signature trait. He idolised her sweetness, her honesty, her sense of purpose in life.
    He watched her intently; twirling and twirling with her arms raised far beyond her petite body. She was a swarm of blonde and pastel blue, and he struggled to focus on every movement of her body. She was far too exquisite, he believed, to even begin to comprehend. She was the aurora of sublime delight.</p>

    <p>Each step she took brushed off waves of potential, of possibility, of divine optimism.</p>

    <p>She was everything for this world, yet simply not enough.</p>

    <p>"I'm going to miss you." He whispered sadly, and abruptly, she halted all movements of her body.</p>

    <p>"You're not as brave as you seem." She crouched beside him, grasping him to her chest. She covered him in kisses. "There is absolutely no chance of us diminishing."</p>

    <p>The grand optimist and the grand pessimist.</p>

    <p>And then they formed their own colours. Her pale mixed with his dark colours; chestnut hair and round brown eyes. "How can I be anything but a defeatist when you are beyond words?"</p>

    <p>"I am here." She cried. "I am present. I am not leaving until you say the words."</p>

    <p>He walked away.</p>

    <p>"You don't have to fear, please, I love you for your heart." He was fading, she could feel it. "And I wonder how a heart like yours could ever love a heart like mine, but we create an effective function and order which allows it to exist." It was the first time he ever saw her not smile. "Listen to me. It won't be me who destroys all we have, but it'll be your insecurities and your destructive thoughts." He didn't speak, he just stared at her blue eyes and the freckles on her nose and the crease between her eyebrows and her small, button nose and her pursed, thick lips. "This love will drive us to insanity."</p>

    <p>And he couldn't utter a word. He was drowned with pain, contorted with secrets. She thought she understood every inch of his mind, but there was one section concealed from her reach.</p>

    <p>He kissed her, because he couldn't think of anything else to do.</p>
